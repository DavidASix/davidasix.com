I've wanted to replace the end-caps on my desk for quite a while, and now that I have a 3d printer I finally can.

I modeled a few versions of my desk end-caps and printed them with my new granite filament. I then decided to make my desk a bit more interesting, and printed some end-caps with holes in them to fit assorted switches and buttons I had laying around.

I've now got 2 switches & 1 button seamlessly integrated into my desk. Not sure why or what purpose they will have, but they are there!

Brenda came in and asked why I had these attached to my desk, then jokingly suggested that pressing the button sends her an alert to come to the office. Funnily enough I think she might be on to something there. What if when you flicked on both switches then pressed the button, an arduino received a signal to send a text message or an email to me, saying the button was clicked.

Not much point to the project, but it could be fun to build!
