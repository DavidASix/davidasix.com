My wife had a very long day at work today and so we decided to get pizza. It was a toss-up of where we go either the Xpress Pizza House or Cheez-Us which had been recently suggested to us.

We landed on Cheez-Us (which my voice-to-text translated to "Jesus") because they had stuffed crust pizza, *and* it was the first menu I looked at. I figured hey I don't want to think anymore, pizza time. 

# The Shop

The outside of the restaurant has an interesting look, with a mix of old world rock facades, and plexiglass sign inside with comic sans bubble letters popping out of it. They have two picnic tables out front, but we decided that we bring it home and eat it in on the couch because it's cold and that's how everybody should eat their pizza.

I was tempted to try the Chicago Pizza that they serve, but Brenda was feeling too hungry for new, and I was feeling too cheap (it was $30+, too expensive for pizza). We picked up our pizza on this frozen evening and despite it not being below zero it was steaming as we walked out of the store. We arrived just seconds before the pizza came out of the oven, so I'm 100% going to burn the top of my mouth on one of the slices. Hopefully it's worth it.

As we drove away with our two pies I remembered to snap a picture of the front, but it's blurry because the pizzas were steaming up my lens.

# It's Pizza Time

We got them home and cracked them open, I got the classic 
- Sun-dried tomatoes
- Bacon
- Pepperoni
With the added twist of stuffed-crust.

Brenda switch it up, and got:
- Sun-dried tomatoes
- Pineapple
- Pepperoni

Time to dig in.

We ate about half our pies and before deciding how we feel about them. The crust is very good, and quite flavorful, but a bit greasy along the bottom. The bottom texture of it almost feels fried because it's bubbly and flaky. I think there must have been grease on a pizza stone to give it that texture. 

The stuffed crust is exactly what you would want if stuffed crust as if somebody took a cheese-string (remember cheese strings?) and rolled it into the crust

Brenda enjoyed the crust a lot, but found the sauce a bit lackluster and decided it's about on par with Gino's. She could see herself having an appetite for Gino's over this and vice versa depending on the day.

I found the toppings to be fair, likely better than papa-joes, but worse than Ginos. The sauce was pretty standard, and the garlic dip was also I'd say "mediocre". It was pretty standard "big-box-store" dip, which tasted strikingly similar to Pizza Pizza's garlic dip.
  
# Final Thoughts

My **biggest** takeaway from Cheez-us though, was the hangover. I felt **absolutely** dehydrated that night and the next day. Even after re-heating the pizza the next day I noted how *super* greasy it was, and that it made me feel dehydrated for the afternoon.

Overall, I don't think I'd order from here again, but I'd certainly eat it if someone else ordered it (though tbf what pizza wouldn't I eat in that case). 6.7/10
