tldr: Amazing garlic dip, solid crust, and fresh toppings. Pepperoni's thick but hey, that's pizza.

Tonight I strayed from our usual Gino’s Pizza to try out Figaro’s Pizza on Weber and Bridgeport. I headed to Figaro's across the street to get a large three-topping pizza with the classic pepperoni, bacon, and sun-dried tomatoes. It was a very rainy fall evening, but on my drive down I saw fireworks lighting up the sky. Folks in the Bridgeport Plaza were celebrating Diwali with some surprisingly serious fireworks, creating big, beautiful starbursts in the sky. I followed the fireworks, and they lead me right to Figaro’s door, to try a new pizza provider.

As I crossed the threshold, I saw the many advertisements on their door for well-priced, good-looking appetizers. While I didn't get any today I might have to try next time I go to Figaro’s. I was greeted by a friendly kid and two older adults, and they all seemed as excited as I was that this pizza had come into existence. I requested my four dips, creamy garlic, of course, and the kid asked if I wanted regular or spicy. Never having had this option, I decided to indulge and got one spicy plus three regulars.

The dips themselves looked great. They’re the kind that clearly come from a big batch which they portion out in-store, rather than being factory-sealed. That usually means they’re either really-good or really-bad.

# It's Pizza Time

First impression: this dip is fucking awesome. Very creamy, very garlicky, exactly what you want from a creamy garlic. The spicy version is pretty good too, could be a little spicier, but overall solid.

The pizza itself is quite good. The dough is nice. The pepperoni is thick, *really* thick, which isn’t necessarily bad, but it’s surprising, and you definitely know when there’s a piece of pepperoni in your mouth.

The bacon, instead of being crumbled, comes in cubes. This is a pretty clear indication (plus the signs on the door that it's halal) that it's beef bacon. It’s not the best I’ve had, but overall fine. 

No complaints about the sun-dried tomatoes; they’re good, seem fresh (well as fresh as dried tomatoes can be).

I’ve decided they must use real garlic in their garlic sauce because it’s got a real *picante* bite.

The pepperoni’s bugging me a bit more now—solely because the pepperoni on top of the cheese is nice and crispy despite being thick, but the pepperoni under the cheese is floppy and still just as thick. That being said, big props to them for actually putting toppings *under* the cheese and *on top* of the cheese. That’s sick.

# Final Thoughts

The garlic sauce is the star of the show, but the fresh ingredients and solid crust make this a very good pizza overall. I think that the odd meats can be a bit suspect if you're not mentally prepared for them, but now that I am aware I'm sure I'll enjoy them more next time. I'll definitely be going here again.
