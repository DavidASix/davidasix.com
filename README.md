# DavidASix Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website. This project is a combination of a front-end site and a Content Management System (CMS). The front-end is built with Next.js and the CMS is powered by FireCMS. Both parts are hosted through a single Firebase project.

## Tech Stack
### Front-End
The front-end of the portfolio is built using [Next.js](# "https://nextjs.org/") in order to take advantage of the power of React as well as the simplicity of Server Side Rendering. The front-end code is located in the [`site`](# "site") directory.
